'''Python for Data Science - Perform Data Science on Titanic Dataset
a)Load the Titanic dataset into one of the data structures (NumPy or Pandas).
b)Display header rows and description of the loaded dataset.
c) Remove unnecessary features (E.g. drop unwanted columns) from the dataset.
d) Manipulate data by replacing empty column values with a default value.
e) Perform the following visualizations on the loaded dataset:
     i)   Passenger status (Survived/Died) against Passenger Class
     ii)  Survival rate of male vs female
     iii) No of passengers in each age group
